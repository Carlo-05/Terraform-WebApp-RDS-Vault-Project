	-	Review each of the modules of this project.

## **3.	Begin project deployment:**
-	Navigate to your working directory, whether in the dev or prod directory.
-	Once you’re in working directory, input this command in your terminal to initialized terraform:

    ```bash

## **4. Test if the web app is working:**
-   for dev, paste the web app instance public ip into your browser:
   
	<div style="text-align: left;">
	<img src="https://github.com/Carlo-05/Terraform-WebApp-RDS-Vault-Project/blob/main/Other%20documents/pictures/How%20to/4..png?raw=true" alt="How to" style="width: 60%; height: auto;">
	</div>

-   for prod, paste the ALB dns address into your browser. Noticed that the intances is interchanging when you refresh the page which means that our ALB is working:
  
	<div style="text-align: left;">
	<img src="https://github.com/Carlo-05/Terraform-WebApp-RDS-Vault-Project/blob/main/Other%20documents/pictures/How%20to/4.1.png?raw=true" alt="How to" style="width: 60%; height: auto;">
	</div>

## **5.	Feel free to explore this project, experiment with its features, and dive into its functionality. Whether you're testing configurations or optimizing workflows, this project is designed for hands-on learning and discovery.**

## **6.	After you’re done exploring the project, we can now deprovision all the resources that’s been created by terraform. This will ensure that there are no unnecessary charges incur by inputting this command:**
